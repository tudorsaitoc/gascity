// Write-auth gates per-city write mutations on a signed, single-use,
// request-bound grant when a verifying key is configured. It covers every
// mutating request to an already-registered city (the routes under
// /v0/city/{cityName}), not only config edits. It is an opt-in hardening on top
// of the existing CSRF/read-only checks: with no key configured the middleware
// is not installed and mutations follow the prior guards; with a key configured
// it is fail-closed — every city-scoped mutation must present a valid grant
// minted by the configured trusted authority.
//
// The bundled first-party callers (the gc API client and dashboard SPA) send
// only the CSRF header and mint no grant, so enabling the gate turns their
// direct city mutations away with a clear 401; an authority-fronted deployment
// supplies grants out of band rather than minting them in this process.

//   - registry creation (POST /v0/city) carries no path-resident city name, so
//     creating a city stays governed by the prior supervisor-registry guards,
//     not this gate. Write-auth covers mutations of cities that already exist
//     (including unregister, which does carry the city in its path).
//   - the /svc/ workspace-service pass-through is exempt (shared grammar).
//
// The /hook/ webhook receiver is deliberately NOT exempted (the H2 reversal): a
// /hook/{name} POST dispatches order → sh -c authenticated by a verifier a pack
// may author, so when write-auth is configured it stays gated on the operator's
// signed grant. Signature verification (E4) is an ADDITIONAL gate for public
// webhooks, never a replacement for this one. Do not add a /hook/ exemption here.
